.SH Description
.PP
xt_asn_build is used to build packed raw representations of the range
database that the xt_asn module relies on. Since kernel memory is precious,
much of the preprocessing is done in userspace by this very building tool. One
file is produced for each country, so that no more addresses than needed are
required to be loaded into memory. The ranges in the packed database files are
also ordered, as xt_asn relies on this property for its bisection approach to
work.
.PP
Since the script is usually installed to the libexec directory of the
xtables-addons package and this is outside $PATH (on purpose), invoking the
script requires it to be called with a path.
.PP Options
.TP
\fB\-D\fP \fItarget_dir\fP
Specifies the target directory into which the files are to be put. Defaults to ".".
.TP
\fB\-S\fP \fIsource_dir\fP
Specifies the source directory from which to read the two files by the name
of \fBGeoLite2\-ASN\-Blocks\-IPv?.csv\fP,
.TP
\fB\-O\fP \fIoutput_file\fP
Specifies an optioan target file to output DNS records for ASN to name
(TXT-RRs) and network (APL-RRs).  Defaults to no output.  The file should be
sorted postprocessing to remove duplicate TXT records and to combine APL-RRs
into a more compact record set.
.SH Application
.PP
Shell commands to build the databases and put them to where they are expected:
