Match a packet by its source or destination autonomous system number (ASN).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-src\-asn\fP, \fB\-\-source\-number\fP \fInumber\fP[\fB,\fP\fInumber\fP\fB...\fP]

.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-dst\-asn\fP, \fB\-\-destination\-number\fP \fIcountry\fP[\fB,\fP\fIcountry\fP\fB...\fP]

The extra files you will need are the binary database files. They are generated
from an ASN-subnet database with the asn_build_db.pl tool that is shipped
with the source package, and which should be available in compiled packages in
/usr/lib(exec)/xtables-addons/. The first command retrieves CSV files from
MaxMind, while the other two build packed bisectable range files:
.PP
mkdir \-p /usr/share/xt_asn; cd /tmp; $path/to/xt_asn_dl;
.PP
$path/to/xt_asn_build \-D /usr/share/xt_asn
.PP
The shared library is hardcoded to look in these paths, so use them.
